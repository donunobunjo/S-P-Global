# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on S&P Global Dataset

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the   **S&P Global stock market dataset**. The analysis aims to uncover key insights about stock price movements, trading activity, and volatility patterns over . The dataset provides us with historical stock prices(5 years: 2013 - 2018) for companies found on the S & P 500 indexime.

By computing financial indicators such as **daily returns**, **moving averages**, and **volatility measures**, the study highlights market dynamics and identifies the top-performing and underperforming stocks. This project demonstrates the ability to work with real-world financial datasets, apply statistical methods, and create meaningful visualizations that aid investment decision-making.


## ‚ùì Key Questions Explored

1. **Daily Returns**

   * How do the daily percentage changes in closing prices vary across different stocks?
   * Which stocks are the most volatile in terms of daily returns?

2. **Top Gainers and Losers**

   * Which 10 stocks recorded the highest daily returns (top gainers)?
   * Which 10 stocks recorded the lowest daily returns (top losers)?

3. **Trading Activity**

   * Which 10 stocks were the most actively traded based on trading volume?
   * Which 10 stocks had the least trading activity?

4. **Trend Analysis**

   * How do stock closing prices compare with their **50-day** and **200-day moving averages**?
   * What long-term vs short-term patterns emerge from the moving average crossover?

5. **Volatility**

   * What is the magnitude of **daily price fluctuations** for each stock?
   * What are the patterns of **monthly volatility** across the dataset?

  Volume-based comparison of the top 10 most traded and least traded stocks.

* **Closing Prices vs Moving Averages (Line Plot)**
  Overlay plots of stock closing prices against their 50-day and 200-day moving averages to highlight short-term and long-term trends.

* **Daily Volatility (Line Plot)**
  Visualization of standard deviation of daily returns across time.

* **Monthly Volatility (Box Plot / Bar Chart)**
  Aggregated monthly price fluctuations for a broader view of long-term market risk.
